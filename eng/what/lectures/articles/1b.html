<h1 class=title>Radio interview</h1>
<br>
<i>Vienna, 05.09.1984.<br></i>
<br>

<b>INTERVIEWER</b>: You as a lady are the teacher,  not only the
teacher but the founder of a Yoga-theory. Is this in common in
India, that  also women do it.  I read that you say,  that all
comes from   Mother  Nature and therefore are there many women
that were teachers in the case you are,  or are  you  in  this
sense of course a unique person?.<br>
<br>


     <b>SHRI MATAJI</b>:  It`s a rather embarrassing question,  isn`t
it? I think a Mother can do a better job than anybody else, in
this respect   you  have  to have lot of patience with people,
isn't it.  Say if it was Christ,  he is  very  nice,   he  got
cruzified and  finished the job.  He was so disgusted and Shri
Krishna would take his Sudahrshan and kill people.  But if you
have to   really emancipate people,  if you have to really see
that they get what they have,   you  have  to  have  the  real
patience of a Mother.<br>
<br>


     <b>INTERVIEWER</b>: So  can you give me some not private details
of your family live.  I read as well in your bio,   that  your
daughters are married, and then you started to do what you are
doing now.  So did you influence them as they were kids?  When
did you start to create your theory, your Yoga?.<br>
<br>


     <b>SHRI MATAJI</b>:   No,   I was quite aware of it from my very
childhood.. I   took  my  birth  in  a  Protestant   Christian
religion, my    father,   my  mother  were enlightened people,
specially my father was a very enlightened person and actually
he told  me what sort of work I`ll have to do,  because of the
problems I`d have with human beings.  He  told  me  how  human
beings are,      their  problems,   and  what  permutationsand
combinations they have.  And then as the custiom is in India I
had to   marry also and I married a very nice man,  then I had
children. I  thought,  that unless and until I reach a certain
age, I  should not start talking about it,  because at a young
age people may not take it seriously.  . Apart from that I had
another problem   that  I found that human beings have certain
permutations and combinations of barriers and if I have to  do
an en-mass   realisation of people,  I`ll have to overcome all
those barriers at a shot,  it means in one lecture I should be
able to give realisation to thousands of people and to work it
out.. I started studying human beings,  tried to  see  through
the subtle mind how I could raise their Kundalini, how I could
give them realisation,  what are their problems.  It took some
time for   me to settle that.  It simultaneously it worked out
with the marriages of my daughters and they settled down. . So
when in 1970,  5th of May,  I saw the way things are happening
and all that and I thought it is the right time to  open  that
last part  of it,  which I had,  the seventh chakra,  and that
then I did it,  and that is the point,  then I really mastered
this en-masse realisation, because so far it was a realisation
of one person or two persons.  And my father told me that  you
are born   really to give this en-mass realisation to people..
So you don`t start talking about it or otherwise you`ll create
another Bible or Gita,  what`s the use. You better work on the
system, that  you understand human beings properly,   and  you
start en-mass realisation,  because if somebody is born on the
10th story,  and somebody is born just on the first floor, you
see, he    cannot  understand  that person and he attacks that
person. So  the best is,  that you raise them higher than from
where they   are  so  that  they  know  at least that there is
something beyond and the  knowledge  of  Sahaja  Yoga  is  not
to-days, so   I would not call it a founder it is in tradition
of spirituality,  it started long time back,  the  realisation
was given  thousands of years back in India,  but it was given
to one or two persons. Even Christ at his time has done a very
great work  of resurrection and in that he has said,  that you
have to be born again.  . It is not just a certificate,  or  a
self opinion  that we are born again or an artificial baptism.
It is   a  real  happening,   is  a  living  happening  within
ourselves, which    has  to take place,  about which of course
Indians know,  because traditionally we are  brought  up  that
way. So  we know that this happens. The knowledge of the roots
is more in India than here,  where it is more the knowledge of
the tree   we  can  say.   Once this happening takes place you
achieve that   new  dimension  which  we  call  as  collective
consciousness, by  which we become collectively conscious. You
can feel another persons centres and you  can  feel  your  own
centres. If   you know how to correct them and how you correct
the centres of another person,  mentally you  can  cure  them,
physically you   can cure them,  emotionally you can cure them
and also they become the citizens of God's domain.<br>
<br>


     <b>INTERVIEWER</b>: So back to your daughters. Do they both also
practice Yoga?.<br>
<br>


     <b>SHRI MATAJI</b>: No, they do not, because I never force them.
I said,  let them take their own time.  In a way this is  good
because if my familiy gets involved,  people might think, that
it`s a family enterprise.  They are  very  good  girls,   very
religious, I    should  say,  very balanced,  very astute.  My
husband is also another very great man. But they are not doing
Sahaja Yoga. I have kept them out, keep out of it but my grand
-children are all born realised,  four of them are,  and  they
are great  Sahaja Yogis.. So these people are out for the time
being, because  it's not proper to have them there.  Also from
another point of view, that when I'm dealing with my children,
you see,  they might think,  they are the daughters of Mataji.
So she adores them,  try to give them money,  and do this, and
it will be quite disturbing. So I don`t want that. I just said
that now   they will come in any case to Sahaja Yoga,  I know,
but this is not the time.  Let people first of  all  establish
themselves properly,  because,  you see,  it gets diverted the
whole attention.<br>
<br>


     <b>INTERVIEWER</b>: Who do you consider to be the  right  person
for Yoga.    Is  there  a  group of people that`s easier to be
caught by Yoga or is it for everybody,  or is it a question of
the personal education of the mind?.<br>
<br>


     <b>SHRI MATAJI</b>:  No,  education is not at all required.  The
simpler you are,  the better it is. Sometimes education can be
a barrier,  because you see you miss the point,as I would say,
if you are to overeducated, but if you have that intelligence,
that innocent   intelligence,  which is so sharp,  it sees the
point very easily.  But a person who is over intelligent,  can
be ego-oriented, you see, and a person who could be say a very
much conditioned and is ritualistic who has faith, blind faith
in things   is  also  difficult.  . So you have to have a very
simple person who is an open  minded  person.   Scientific  in
outlook, I should say would be better but most of the people I
meet are such kind are mostly in the villages in India or  say
places where     not   so  much  of  so  called  artificiality
sophistication is there,  they are normal human  beings,   and
they live down to earth.<br>
<br>


     <b>INTERVIEWER</b>: Youth  in  Western  Europe,   in  America is
looking for a destination or  for  a  destiny  or  not  for  a
destiny, but    they are seeking for the beyond.  Doesn't this
also mean that Western philosophy doesn`t offer a  proper  way
for the   beyond for the way there as more as get in some case
included in Eastern pholosophy,  if we say in general Yoga  is
Eastern pholosophy.    Do  you  see  that  it  that  the  high
industrialized western world has a lack of ways  to  offer  to
the mental human being?.<br>
<br>


     <b>SHRI MATAJI</b>:    That's  what  I  was  telling  the  other
gentleman also,  you see, the Western civilization is like the
tree outside,   and the Eastern understanding of the Spirit is
like your roots.  So there is a continuity,  I mean  I  cannot
separate one   from  another,   you need the tree and the tree
needs the roots also.  Roots must have the tree, you cannot do
without it   so,  both things are complementary to each other.
But when there is an imbalance,  like a tree  grows  too  much
beyond, and  it does not reach its source and then there could
be a destruction.  That's what exactly  has  happened  in  the
West, that     you  have  overdeveloped  yourself,   and  that
overdevelopement has  led  you  to  a  problem.   Because  you
exhausted the Mother Earth, exhausted your energies, exhausted
your brains,  everything is at an exhausted point. So now it's
better to  get to the roots.  So when you get to the roots you
find, you  have not reached the source.  Where is the  source?
Source lies   within yourself the human being himself and that
source is to be found out.  And that  source  is  the  Spirit,
which all   the great saints,  all the great incarnations,  in
their own   traditional  way,   has  one  after  another  have
expressed and told. But everybody has misunderstood and made a
mess out of it.  We  have  organized  God,   we  haveorganized
Christ, we   have organized Mohammed Sahab,  we have organized
everyone, but  they are living things,   you  cannot  organize
them. <br>
<br>


     <b>INTERVIEWER</b>: But if I'm a top manager of Ford, of IBM, am
I really the person to do Yoga,  doesn't this mean, if someone
part of   this  highly industrialised Western world,  that the
Eastern philosophy is offered me any  time.   Isn't  there  an
either or? .<br>
<br>


     <b>SHRI MATAJI</b>:   No,  you become really dynamic because you
become a witness of the whole play,  you see this  play,   you
become dynamic,    there  is  no  pressure,   no tension,  you
understand everything in all dimensions.  Apart from that  you
develop a balance,  you know how far to go.  I mean, you don't
overdevelop something.  You develop a proper  perspective,   a
balanced developement  and that is what is necessary.  We have
lost the balance.<br>
<br>


     <b>INTERVIEWER</b>: Don't you know many people who want more  of
yoga than yoga can give.  So doesn't yoga also have in Western
Europe a point that it doesn't give to the individual that so,
people think,    well  I  can reach so many things by yoga and
don't realise, that they can just find themselves.<br>
<br>


     <b>SHRI MATAJI</b>:  You see,  Yoga is a big misnoma in the West
people don't know what yoga is.  If you read Patanjali,  it is
said that you have to get to your  self-realisation  and  then
how to  grow in your self-realisation.  Once you start growing
in your self-realisation,  you develop such a personality that
you see the whole world as one.  You reach your wholesomeness.
And when you reach your wholesomeness the complete balance and
the curative   sense  comes  in.  For instance,  if there is a
problem in my left finger,  I try  to  rub  it  and  I  soothe
myself, whom   am I helping,  whom am I supporting,  what is a
developing country,  what is a developed  country?   You  need
something from   the  developing  and  you  have  to  have the
developed. So  the whole thing is,  that we have not  got  the
wholesomeness. We    are  not  integrated  so  far.  It's only
possible when you reach that point,  which is within us, which
is collectively  conscious,  and that is the Spirit.  Once you
reach that point,  you get collective consciousness,  and when
you become   collective,   you understand the wholesomeness of
yourself. . So what people are seeking here in yoga, is really
something that   is  brought  from  there  by people who don't
understand. Yoga  means union with the Divine,  it means union
with the   Divine.   When you become one with the Divine,  the
Divine starts flowing through you  and  you  become  part  and
parcel of   the whole.  You become.  It's not question of just
taking a certificate.  It's  not  running  on  the  street  or
standing on   your  heads,   it's  not  Yoga  that you have to
understand that,  if there is a problem,  a physical  problem,
what exercise particularly you have to do.  But that,  too, is
only possible,  when  you  get  your  realisation.   .  Before
realisation you   don't know where you are sick.  People don't
know, they  go mad,  but they don't know that they are getting
mad. So the craziness that you find or the imbalances you find
is lost,  because we have just turned our faces to that thing,
called the  Spirit.  Because we could not reach there with our
mental projection.  So what we have to do,  is to just take to
this new   dimensional approach by which you become that thing
that you have to become,  for which  you  have  come  on  this
earth, and  that,  if you get it, you are there. . You have so
many dimensions. I mean now for me, you know, I am a wife of a
person who has to shake hands sometimes with 600 people on one
side and I have to deal with people on that level,   and  that
sort of   people  I am also doing this and I have decorated my
house. I mean, I can do 1000 and one thing and still I am very
relaxed person. So what you have to achieve is everything what
we talk of,  we talk of democracy,  we talk of communism, both
are artificial  to my mind,  because unless and until you have
something, how  are you a capatilist?  We are nothing. What do
we have?  We have nothing,  but plastics. What do we have? You
see, that  you have something like I would say,  I am a  great
capitalist because  I have all the power and I am the greatest
communist, because I must distribute. So, in the essence, I am
the real capitalist and the real communist.  So all your ideas
are really the glimpses of that great truth. I am the greatest
communist, I'm  the greatest capitalist.  All your ideas about
economics. Economics  is so sensible,  that it says in general
want is not satiable in particular they are. So that means the
want, that  means  this  matter  is  not  going  to  give  you
satisfaction. So    where  is  the satisfaction?  It is in the
Spirit. Everything  aims at that point.  One should  see  that
point.<br>

<br>

         <b>INTERVIEWER</b>: Thank you.<br>
		 <br>
		 

         <b>SHRI MATAJI</b>: May God bless you.<br>
