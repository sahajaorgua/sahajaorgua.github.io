<h1 class=title>Public Program</h1>
<br>
<i>Kyiv, September 25, 1995<br></i>
<br>

I bow to all the seekers of Truth. We have to know at the very outset that Truth is what it is. You cannot change it, you cannot describe it , you cannot transform it. Whatever I am going to tell you tonight you should not take it for granted. Blind faith has harmed us the most. So it is important that you should keep your mind open like scientists. And then what I am telling you should be treated like a hypothesis. If it is proved then as honest people you have to accept it. Because it is for your benevolence, it is for the benevolence of your family, for the benevolence of your city, your country and for the benevolence of the whole world. At this juncture when we are facing problems all over the world it is important to understand why do we have problems. The problems are there because we do not know the Absolute Truth. You don't know about your physical, emotional, mental being. And it is said that if you don't know yourself you cannot know God or Divinity. You say, "This is my hand, this is my head". My! Who is this my?<br>
<br>


So what is the Truth? That you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not these emotions, you are not this intelligence, you are not this ego or your conditionings. But you are the Pure Spirit. For example, if I am born in a Christian family or a Hindu family, or a Moslem family immediately I accept the conditionings without understanding what good it has done to the world or to yourself. And thus we start living in a hanging condition. So the second truth is that there is all-pervading power of Divine Love which does all the living work. You see here such beautiful flowers. It's a miracle. We never know how it comes out of one seed, one bulb all these beautiful flowers. We take all this for granted. If you ask a doctor, who runs your neart, he will say, "It's an Autonomous Nervous System". But who is this auto? Who looks after us? This is what one has to understand that there a superior power beyond us which does all these things. I find the peo- ple of Russia and Ukraine too much impressed by the Americans. I just don't understand. Because compared to you Americans are just stupid people. They have no wisdom. Compared to you they don't understand life. To them every moment must be spent in enjoyment. And every enjoyment they discover is self-destructive. It has destroyed their body with horrible diseases. It has destroyed their mind with perversion and schizophrenia. It has destroyed the whole society, the family, everything by their own idea of this enjoyment. You people living here must be thinking that their whole country is paved with gold. It is such a violent country that every individual is a mafia. When I go to America I have to take out all these ornaments which I am supposed to wear from my family. Their music is maddening. There was one fellow who was really mad while singing. That was no music, it was just like a shouting noise. And then he used to take the whole of his throat out of him. Itself the singing was horrifying. And he called his group as Nirvana meaning "ultimate spiritual liberation". And though he used to drink, smoke, take drugs, ultimately he committed suicide. I think it is important you must see some of them and know what sort of a country it is.<br>
<br>


So God has given you this wisdom because you have been ancient people. Do you know about your ancientity? I was so surprised to read about it. You have a great relationship with Indians. They say the "Ukraine" name came from a king called Kuru. He was the forefather of Pandavas and Kauravas in India. Also it was said that Shri Rama came here and built this place Kiev. Before the Christian religion came in there was such a beautiful faith in this Kundalini. I studied the paintings and the museum, pieces, where it is absolutely shown this Kundalini. They have shown the Primodial Mother and Kundalini also they have shown in their paintings. And lowest chakra called mooladhara that has got a frame like a swastika is all there in the painting. All these chakras, everything, are there. And you don't know what were your forefathers. They were all very spiritual. The spirituality has given such a fertile land to you. I was amazed the way in this country spirituality was striving at that time. Now I know why you, people, and Russians are so sensitive to spirituality. It's in your blood. You can't help it. You'll be never satisfied with something artificial. For the time maybe impressed by America. But you will realize it's stupidity and come back to your original culture. I was amazed how these people were in those days. They called themselves Arians. And also they came to India. And so many from India came here. For a normal Indian the goal of life is to get self realization. As also Christ has said that know thyself. And also Mohammad said, "The one who does not know himself is not a complete person. And he cannot know about Divinity". With all these sayings and understanding one knows the goal of his life. And from ancient times, 3000 B.C., in this country people knew their goal. Not drinking, not other dirty things they do in America. Only the false people can impress them. They only understand money. How can a spiritual person be money-oriented? Those who are money-oriented cannot be near God. But as a blessing of God, all kinds of prosperity come. You don't have to run after prosperity, the prosperity runs after you.<br>
<br>


So within you is already placed this great instrument by our Creator. All of you have this within you. This is your own mother. Everybody has an individual mother. It's like a tape record of your past and your aspirations. She knows everything about you. And she is anxious to give you your second birth. This is all your own. Now we have become human beings in the evolutionary process which is a living process. And now there is going to be one more breakthrough by which this Kundalini rises like a primula in the seed and passes through your fontanel bone area and becomes one with the all-pervading power of Divine Love. Just like this instrument, if it is not connected to the mains it has no meaning, we have no meaning, we have no personality, we go on drifting from here to there. When this happens then you are connected with this all-pervading power and this power starts flowing through you on your finger tips. So you can feel the Absolute Truth on your finger tips. Because you know what chakras are in trouble. Also you know about others, because you get connected with this all-pervading power. You develop a new dimension called as collective consciousness. With this new awareness you can know the centers of others. All your problems are there because your centers are in jeopardy. Through this awakening of the Kundalini there have been thousands and thousands of cures of incurable diseases. If you remember, first time when I came here there were so many people sick of Chernobyl destiny. And with Kundalini awakening. they got cured. All their problems are solved. None of them died. They must be some people sitting here. That's the minimum. There are four doctors in India who have got now M.D. in Sahaja Yoga. In Russia, I think, there are about 200 doctors who are following Sahaja Yoga and curing people for no money at all. So money is not so important. The second thing that happens to you that, you become mentally absolutely peaceful. Like our thoughts rise and fall, rise and fall, and they come to us from our past and our future. And our mind is jumping on the cusp of the thoughts. If I say now "come to our present", you cannot. But when this Kundalini rises she separates the thoughts and elongates them. And you become thoughtlessly aware. You are aware but you are thoughtless. That is the present. Thus your memory becomes just photogenic. Now for example, this very beautiful carpet is not mine. Normally, I would think how much to pay, how much to buy. If it is mine also I would say that it should not get spoilt. But when I see in thoughtless awareness all the joy that is put into it to make it starts pouring on me as soothing current. In the present if you want you can think, and if you don't want you don't think. You become absolutely peaceful. And then you start emitting peace to others. Wherever you go you can create peace, not by giving awards of peace to people. On the contrary, I've seen, these people are very hot tempered. They have peace awards but you can't talk to them, they jump on you. So one has to understand that there is a space within us for peace, which makes not only you peaceful but makes others also peaceful.<br>
<br>


The third thing that happens to you that your attention becomes enlightened. Christ has said, "Now shall not have adulterous eyes". But your attention becomes moral. I don't have to say "don't do this, don't do that". Only in the light of Spirit you yourself become absolutely moral. We can say like angels. So this is within you which works out. I've seen some criminals becoming angels. Because the data base of their genes changes also. It is so fantastic. But you are fantastic, you are glorious. Only thing you are to get connected. Now one has to know that this all-pervading power of Divine Love is the ocean of compassion and love. It is the ocean of knowledge. All the real knowledge is not from the books, not from the words, but the real knowledge about reality. It is the ocean of so many miracles and so many blessings. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. Whatever wrong you might have done, whatever mistakes you might have committed, all are forgiven by this Divine Power of Love. Truth is Love, Love is peace and all of them are one. You become the master of it. You don't dominate others, you don't torture others, but you love. And this Love is without any lust or greed. Above all this ocean of Love is the ocean of joy. You become joyous. Joy is not like happiness or unhappiness. It is singular. You enjoy yourself, you enjoy the nature, you enjoy everything. It is such a remarkable thing that is going to happen. We can say now there is a global transformation. So there will be no words, no arguments, no discussions. Because everybody will know the same truth. No fixed ideas. It is just reality.<br>
<br>


I was so impressed by your forefathers who have done so much already for spirituality. And I am sure you all have special right to become one with this Divine Power. It's like you put a seed in the Mother Earth and it sprouts by itself. And your forefathers believed in the Mother Earth as made by the Primodial Mother. Imagine, they have Kundalini depicted. How many people in the world knew about Kundalini except for Indians? But surprisingly the ancient Colombians also knew about it. That was their faith. They might have seen it, they might have felt it. So you have 'such blessings of your forefathers. It is going to work out. I know all of you are going to get your self realization tonight. Only thing you must have faith in yourself. You should not feel guilty about anything. You don't have to confess anything. You don't have to change your dress or change your hair style, nothing of the kind. It is not superficial, it is within. But you must have full self confidence in you. You must know that you are going to get it. And that you have to forgive yourself. If you have comitted some mistakes, finished. What's the use of feeling guilty? Another thing is you have to forgive everyone from your heart. Only thing is that as the Mother Earth has the power to germinate, the seed has built-in power to get germinated, you also get your realization in the sense of awakening the Kundalini. But you must look after your self realization. We have some very good Sahaja Yogis here who can guide you how to meditate only for ten minutes in the evening. But you should not leave it in the middle. It would be like the parable of Christ that some seeds which got germinated were thrown in the marsh. That would be something like that. If you respect yourself then this self knowledge should grow. It's for free. You cannot pay for Divine Love. Many people don't understand. How much do we pay to this Mother Earth for these flowers? Because this is your own, your own right to have your self realization. So time is there , we have to have our experience of self realization. And we have to feel this all-pervaiding power for the first time. So I would request all of you first of all to have self confidence, then to forgive yourself and to forgive others. Now you might say that it is difficult to forgive. But just think logically whether you forgive or don't forgive what you do. So you don't do anything. But you torture yourself for nothing at all. All your life you tortured yourself like that. But at this moment it is very important. In the brain there is the optic chiasma where this centre is. And this centre is constricted like this. It won't open unless and until you forgive everyone. So how will the Kundalini come up? Now when you don't forgive and feel guilty this centre catches here on the left very badly. Physically also you might develop a disease called as angina for the heart, also spondylitis and lethargic organs. So please, forgive yourself. At this moment it is very important that this centre should open and this centre should open so the Kundalini will rise. You go beyond the mind into reality. When we have the power of our mind which just move in a lineal way. And then it recoils because there is no truth in it and harms you. It can harm the society like Freud. He had some funny ideas. He had harmed Americans completely like Hitler. So many of them. But if it is the light of the Spirit, it moves in all the sides. It penetrates into all subtle things and never recoils. So you have to develop your spiritual awareness. When I come I know there are thousands and thousands, but when I go away that doesn't mean you should not grow. So when I come there is a kind of a periodic sort of understanding. But it's a living process, you have to look after it and you have to grow into it. Once you achieve the second state which we call as doubtless awareness, you will know how great you are, what powers you have. I've seen people becoming great scientists, great artists, great musicians through Sahaja Yoga. Even the children become very, very intelligent, alert, obedient and moral. Overnight I've seen people giving up drugs, alcoholism, all these destructive things.<br>
<br>


Now I am 73 years of age. And I am travelling every third day. And I don't feel tired. Because human energy is limitted, but if you get this Divine energy then what does it matter? So to make it flowing to you you must grow into it. This is my request as a Mother. So it will take hardly about five - ten minutes for you to feel your realization through this all-pervading power. I would request you not to disturb at that time. If you want you can go away before we start it, so that people are not disturbed. One thing, I cannot force it on you, because I respect your freedom. And in your freedom you have to ask for it. You must have pure desire to have it, because this Kundalini is the power of pure desire. So I'll wait for one minute, if somebody wants to leave he can leave. First I'll try a very short method, which well worked in Russia. Please, put your hands like this towards me. Don't close your eyes. Now, please, put your left hand towards me like this. And now bend your head. And now see for yourself if there is a cool or hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now, please, put your right hand towards me. Again bend your head, and, please, see with your left hand if you are feeling cool or hot breeze coming out of fontanel bone area. It is hot because you have not forgiven yourself and you have not forgiven others. Now take the left hand, bend your head again and put your right hand and see, if there a cool or hot breeze coming out of your own head. Sometimes it comes nearer the head, sometimes little away. But don't touch your head, above head. Please, now put your hands towards me and watch me without thinking. Now, please, put both your hands towards the sky like this and ask in the heart one of the questions. "Mother, is this a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Ask three times in your heart. Otherwise you can ask, "Mother, is this the all-pervading power of Divine Love?" Again three times. Or else you can ask, "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya?" Again three times in your heart. Now bring down your hands. All those who have felt cool breeze or hot breeze on the finger tips, on the palms or out of the fontanel bone area, have to raise their hands. See! My God! May God bless you all! See, this is the first time you are feeling this breeze. I told you that this is a country of great spiritual people. This is the proof. All of you have felt it. But I again request you that, please, try to continue to grow till I come next year. Another simple thing you can see these Ukrainian people singing so well Hindi songs, Marati songs, Sanskrit songs. If you don't see them you will think that Indians are singing. It's very difficult. But how they manage, I don't know. So let them sing one song. I would like also to hear. You will sing Jogwa? This is a song written in the 16th century by a saint in India, in Maharashtra, my state, in Marati. He is saying, "Oh Mother, give me this Yoga, this union with the Divine". And then he says, "I will give up all that is bad, all that is wrong, I'll do everything, but give me this Yoga". And all the people in the villages sing it, though they don't know what it is. It is now the other way round. You don't have to give up anything. You don't have to go to Himalayas. Sitting here you can get your Yoga, your union with the Divine. (Ukrainian musicians are performing the song). May God bless you! Please, respect your self realization, respect yourself. All my love! I'll come next year again to meet you. If you have any problems you can write to me through the leaders here. Thank you.<br>
