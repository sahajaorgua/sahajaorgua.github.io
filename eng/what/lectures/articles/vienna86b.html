<h1 class=title>ORF-INTERVIEW "LEBENSBILDER"</h1>
<br>
<i>9. July 1986, VIENNA<br></i>
<br>

<b>Shri Mataji:</b> So you want me to talk about my life.  It's a
good thing, because  I have to go for that  interview in Italy,
it's a good preparation I mean for that, because I really don't
know what to say about my own life.<br>
<br>


     <b>Interviewer:</b> Can you speak about your whole life?<br>
	 <br>
	 

     <b>Shri Mataji:</b> I'm a story teller (Shri Mataji laughs) It is
something like an autobiography.<br>
<br>


     <b>Interviewer:</b>  Can you  describe  the circumstances  during
your childhood?<br>
<br>


     <b>Shri  Mataji:</b> I  belong to  a family  of very  enlightened
people.  My father was a linguist and he was master of fourteen
languages.  He knew  about 26 languages and  he translated even
Koransharif into Hindi language.  My  mother was in those days,
was  a  honours  in  mathematics.    So  both  they  were  very
well-educated and enlightened people.<br>
<br>


     At the time of my  birth my mother dreamed something which
she could not  explain.  But after that she had  a great desire
to go and see a tiger in the open field.  My father was a great
hunter, because tigers were a menace  in the area where we were
living.  It was a hill-station  called Chindwara.  So there was
a king who was very much interested in my father.<br>
<br>


     Somehow or another a letter  came that there is  a tiger,
very big tiger and they are  frightened of him that he might be
a maneater.   So my father took  my mother  and moved  to that
place.  And  they were  sitting in what we  call as  a Machan.
Where they built something for people  to sit on top of a tree,
from where they can shoot nicely.   And then my mother tells me
that  a big  huge tiger,  of  very big  size, very  beautifully
appeared  on the  field and  she felt  tremendous love  for the
tiger.<br>
<br>


     It  was   a  full   moon  day   and  she   felt  extremely
compassionate towards the  tiger and when my  father raised his
gun  to shoot,  she stopped  and she  wouldn't allow  him.  The
tiger went away and he never came to that forest again.<br>
<br>


     But that  made my  father think, because  he himself  is a
realised soul.   That must be  somebody what we call  a goddess
Durga, who  is fond  of the  tiger must be  born to  my mother,
because the  symptoms where rather  funny that the  lady should
like  to see  a tiger.   So  he told  my mother:  "Now are  you
satisfied?"  Because they  were  struggling with  the gun.   He
said: "Is  there of Durga  sitting in  your womb, that  you are
trying to protect a tiger?" She  said: "Yes, yes stop it now, I
won't allow you!".<br>
<br>


     Like that there were many incidents in my life, because I
am of  a Christian family, Protestants  and when I was  born my
mother  didn't feel  any labour-pains  or anything  just I  was
born.  She  did not  know how and  I had no  blood on  my body,
nothing.  I was clean  washed that  is why  they called  me as
Nirmala.<br>
<br>


     But  my grandmother  said that  she should  be called  as
Nishkalanka.  That  means the  one which has  no spots  on her.
But that is the  name of a man.  So they  said alright we call
her Nirmala meaning the same - Immaculate.<br>
<br>


     Now  all these  incidents.  And  then my  father, being  a
realized soul,  he felt  tremendous vibrations  from me  and he
felt that  this life is  great and  that she will  do something
great in this life.  I do not  know why, but I don't know if he
dreamed or  he understood it,  but all  the time if  I remember
when he talked  to me, he used  to say that: "You  have to find 
out the way of giving "en mass" realisation all the time.<br>
<br>


     As I  told you, he was  a great scholar of  so many things
and a very wide  read man, so he gave me  a good education in
religion,  in different  religions, and  also a  good education
about human beings.  What are their problems?  Why did they act
like  this?   Why  don't  they  take  to  God?   Why  are  they
hypocritical?  All kind of things he talked to me.<br>
<br>


     He also knew about Kundalini.  But not so much.  Of course
when I was born, I knew all about Kundalini myself.  I knew all
about it, from my very childhood.  So I was a very aware person
- extremely aware.   I did not know how to talk to, because -
you see - people did not have that awareness, you can't talk to
everyone like that.<br>
<br>


     So I was regarded as a  very joyful person at the same time
very serious also, very deep and then I started my studies as a
child.  I was not very much interested in the studies, though I
used to do them  very well.  But I used to read lives of great
men and things like that.<br>
<br>


     At a very young age I read Bernard Shaw.  When people were
reading their expectations I was  reading Bernard Shaw.  But as
such I did not have any interest in particular, in reading some
text books, because I thought  they were childish and there was
nothing to be read about it.  Then I told my father that I have
to do medicine.  So he said:  "Why?" I said: "Because I have to
talk  to doctors."  He said:  "You  have to  talk to  doctors?"
"Yes!", I said.<br>
<br>


     But it  so happened in  my childhood,  when I was  about 7
years  of age.   My father  was  a congressman,  he had  joined
congress when  I was 4  years of age.  He  used to live  with a
style very westernized - you see.  He threw away everything and
became a real  Indian and started leading a life  of a martial.
Then he made us study our languages, Sanskrit he made us study
in an Indian school not in a missionary school.<br>
<br>


     Because missionary is very, very unkind.  They threw us out
of the school,  when my father was in the  congress.  They were
against  us completely.   Then at  the  age of  seven years,  I
happened to go with my father  to Mahatma Gandhi.  He was about
70 miles  living with us.  But  the first time he  took me down
and Mahatma  Gandhi, he  liked me very  much.  He  said: "Leave
this child here!"<br>
<br>


     So I had  not taken clothes or anything to  stay there and
my father sent  to me everything.  And he was  very fond of me.
But I  was a  little girl.   But he  understood that  there was
something about me.   He consulted me on  very serious problems
sometimes, surprisingly.  Like  one day he wanted to  make me a
prayer-book alright, so  he asked me: "How should  I put these
series and all that." So I told  him, how to put the series and
he put the series in that way.<br>
<br>


     I used to  go back for my  school and again to  go back to
Gandhiji.  Every year like that.   And he called me Nepali.  He
gave me a name "Nepali".  Everybody used to call me Nepali that
time.  Then I  grew up with him very intimately,  he was a very, 
very kind person for children.<br>
<br>


     Otherwise an  extremely strict man, with  himself and with
others, very strict.  A big disciplined man.  And he would make
everybody get  up at 4  o'clock, have your baths  everything be
ready for your morning prayers at 5  o'clock - you see - and he
used to walk very fast.  I  also learned walking fast with him.
In his company I had to walk fast.<br>
<br>


     And he had  been extremely loving and a  very nice person.
And he would listen to me,  because I was a child.  Supposing I
had forced  him to  eat more  or something  then he  would have
laughed and accepted.  Very kind person.<br>
<br>


     But with others, he was very strict and I used to tell him
that: "Why  are you strict with  them too much?" He  said: "But
you are  a little girl,  you got up  in the morning,  why can't
they get up?" I  said: "I am little, that's why  I get up, they
are big,  so they  can't get  up." Like that  you see  a little
child.<br>
<br>


     Then my  father went to  jail and  my mother also  went to
jail five times.  My father went to jail twice.  Once for about
two and a half years and  he was the only supporting member of
the family.  By the way we  came from a very old royal familiy,
which is called as Shalivahanas.   They have a calender also in
India.<br>
<br>


     And then, when they took my father to jail we had to leave
our  house and  we had  to live  in huts  and had  all kind  of
problems.  But  also me, they  pestered a lot because  I helped
many people there.   I joined effort to movement and  in a very
serious  way I  became the  leader  there.  But  we were  young
people.<br>
<br>


     I thought unless  and until I take a  very positive stand,
it may not work  out with them.  It is not  gracious to say how
they  tortured me.   What  they  did to  me.   But they  really
tortured me.   I was a  young girl of nineteen years  that time.
It is over  now, so it is finished.  After  that my father went
to jail again and then when he came back, he got elected as the
member of the central assembly,  later on as the constructor of
the assembly and then of the parliament.<br>
<br>


     My brother was also member of the parliament later on, now
recently he was the minister  in the cabinet.  Another brother
is  a high-court  judge in  Bombay.   They are all doing  well
despite  the fact,  that our  parents  neglected us  in a  way,
because they  gave their lives  to the country, but  that never
deterred as from studies and we came up very well.<br>
<br>


     When I was in 1942  two movement my college justicabled me
from the college and threw me out  and I had to go to another
college to  study far away from  my house.  Then I  studied for
two years science.  Then I did  my medical.  I didn't do fully,
because just after  that the 1947 riots broke  out.  So college
was closed  and I  did not  want to know  more, because  what I
wanted to know, I  think to know about it.  So  I did not need,
and I got married.<br>
<br>


     You must have  heard my husband work is  now the secretary
in general of the International Maritime Organisation.  He held
very high positions.  He was  also secretary to Shastri who was
our prime minister, who was another very great man.  But he did
not survive  long.  If he  had survived things would  have been
different, I think, for our country, because he was a Gandhian, 
out and out Gandhian.<br>
<br>


     I mean  he lived like  an ideal Gandhian  personality.  So
that's how my life went on.   But inner being was still seeking
the way and methods of giving "en mass" realization.<br>
<br>


     My father said: "Before you  do not develop this technique
of giving  "en mass"  realization do  not talk  about religion.
Let nobody know  that you know anything about  it, because they
will  crucify you  or...." He  was rather  worried that  people
won't understand, or you may write  another Bible or Gita - no
use.<br>
<br>


     First of all you must  give them realization.  If they get
their  realization  then  they   will  realize  that  there  is
something about  it, about this human  awareness.  For example,
he always  used to give an  analogy.  Supposing we are  born on
the tenth  storey and everybody is  on the ground.  You  must at
least make  them climb two  storeys so  they know that  there is
something above.  Otherwise no use talking about it.<br>
<br>


     And he said:  "This is the mistake between  the saints and
the  incarnations  was, that  they  never  realized that  these
people are still on the ground.   They have to still enter into
the medium.  So  that is what you have to  be very careful that
first of all you must give realization to them."<br>
<br>


     So  I was  seeking the  ways and  methods, working  it out
inside myself through  my own style of meditation  in the sense
that I would work out all the permutations and combinations and
when  I met  one person  then I  would see  what problems  that
person had, how  you can overcome it, like that  I would try to
study that person internally.<br>
<br>


     And I  went to many people  to find out, but  I found they
were great  hypocrites.  I saw so  many of these Gurus,  most of
them.   When I saw them,  I  was  surprised  they  were  all
hypocrites.  Money making  and also.  I went to  Rash Neesh also
to see him  and he said that  I should come to  his program.  I
did not  know what sort  of man,  because he was  talking about
Gita and I thought he might be knowing something about it.<br>
<br>


     I went there  but my husband said: "No, I  won't allow you
to go to this program.  So he arranged his own........  There I
could see all the things which  were going on.  And that is the
day somehow or  another I said: "I must open  the last chakra!"
So the last chakra was opened and I saw the Kundalini, which is
the primordial force within us,  which is the Holy Ghost within
us, rising, like  a telescope opening out.  And then  I saw the
whole thing  open and  a big torrential  rain of  beams started
flowing through my head all over.<br>
<br>


     I felt I am lost, I am  no more, there it's only the grace
is there, that is there.  I  saw it completely happening to me.
But I  was amazed that  when I went  to Rash Neesh,  because he
forgot even to say good bye, because he never realized what had
happened or  anything, so  I was surprised,  I said:  "This man
doesn't know  anything about God!"  and then I  discovered that
they are all hypocrites and they are telling lies.<br>
<br>


     So in 1970, 5th of May this happened and  just after that
we had a very big lecture in  Carnagy Hall.  This is a very big
hall and  thousands of  people had  come and  I told  them very
frankly that  these are all  thugs and hypocrites, some  of them
are  demonic,  some  are  evil  people.   I  told  their  names
everything.  I  told them:  "Do not go  near them!"  There were
some foreigners also.<br>
<br>


     And there  were so  many others whom  I told  these things
very clearly and  they got frightened.  They  said: "You should
not say like this.  They will  come and murder you." But nobody
did anything  and nobody even  went to the courts.   And that's
how they try to  bring bad name to me.  They  paid money to the
newspapers to publish  things against me, because  I said: "You
cannot pay  money!" So they thought  that I was trying  to harm
them by  saying such a thing  that you can't take  money in the
name of God.<br>
<br>


     If it is a job you can do  it, but Gods work is not a job.
And  the  struggle  started  from  the  day  I  started  giving
realization.  And I  started with one lady  who got realization
first.  Then  we got about  twelve people who  got realization.
In  two  years got  only  about  14 people  realization.   Then
gradually  when  14 people  got  realization  then many  others
started getting realization.<br>
<br>


     But I started also curing people, because that was helping
a lot.  Then my husband got elected  to this post and we had to
come to London.<br>
<br>


     So  when I  came to  London we  had one  program.  So  the
Indians abroad are not so much interested in God, they are more
interested  in money.   So none  of the  Indians stayed  there.
They all run away and only  the foreigners who were there, were
about  seven hippies  and so  I  had to  work on  them -  seven
hippies - for four years I was working on them to give them the
realization.  They  were difficult, their liver  was bad, their
head was  off, terrible time.   But in between  I used to  go to
India.<br>
<br>


     And  in India  also the  work was  done.  For  three month
always I  have been  in India.   So we  started working  in the
villages,  specially  surprisingly  were my  forefathers  were
ruling in  that area.  There  we started  moving in a  very big
way.  And there then we started taking the people from India.<br>
<br>


     And some  people came from  Australia to India,  like that
and the work started moving in those directions.  Gradually the
work improved  and people  found that  this is  the way  we can
transform  ourselves.   Many  people   were  taking  drugs,  or
alcoholics or mad people all kinds of people.  They felt better
and they  got cured.   It was established  that Sahaja  Yoga is
something very important.<br>
<br>


     Now, when  I travel all  over the world first  my husband
used to pay for everything, wherever I went he had to pay - any
expenses he used  to do for me.  Gradually now  this people pay
for  my travel,  but  otherwise they  do not  have  to pay  for
anything else.  That is how we started our work.  There was lot
of opposition  and the media-people would  never understand it.
Because it was not such a  sensation as you can say, nothing to
people  feel exited  but in  a way  it is  a very  great thing,
because this is the solution of the whole world, one should try
to do it.<br>
<br>


     Then we  had very  great people who  came to  Sahaja Yoga,
like  we can  say the  main high  court judge,  who is  now the
president,  who has  given  Nicaragua some  judgement and  many
lawyers  and even  barrister. We  have one  barrister here  from
Algeria and  doctors and then  they took over and  they started
helping me out how to propagate Sahaja Yoga.<br>
<br>


     But it  was a difficult  task in  the west.  Of  course in
India it is  spreading very fast in the villages,  but the city
people in India  also the people are westernized  and they will
start analysing.   They don't  know much  about our  past, they
don't  know  anything  about  our heritage  that  we  have  our
Kundalini.<br>
<br>


     But some people do know about selfrealization.  But these
Gurus could not  stick on in India because  nobody would accept
them.  So they  all run away abroad.  And that  was something a
blessing for  me also,  because I  did not  have to  fight them
there.  And it  started working out and then  people found that
it helps in every way and  they found so many miracles about it
and that's how Sahaja Yoga was settled quite a lot.<br>
<br>


     But still  I would say  that we  have not been  to certain
countries so far and in the west, I would say that so much work
has to be done there, because as  soon as you start any work in
any place first of all they want  me to cure people and to help
them with cure.  Now if I pay attention more to that then the
main  work  is  to  create  doctors out  of  everyone  that  is
neglected then  you become  unpopular.  They think:  "Oh, she's
not sympathetic", this and that.<br>
<br>


     But now  as we  have everybody can  cure now  everyone.  I
don't cure anyone directly.  But  they don't like it, they want
I should be  there and their ego  to be pampered and  all these
things are  there, it's rather  difficult.  We are  not running
any lecture like  we should please others, sort  of things, not
that, but whatever  is reality.  If a  person has intelligence,
pure  intelligence, he  can  see that  this  is something  very
different.<br>
<br>


     And for that  one has to understand that  you cannot force
on anyone  that you get  your realization  in the same  way you
cannot force  me that I  give you realization, because  if does
not work, it does not work, it's such a living force.  And that
upsets them  very soon.   I feel that  the way  this industrial
revolution  has  come in  the  west.   People have  lost  their
knowings  perhaps they  are so  confused with  all these  gurus
coming  down here  confusing them  and all  kind of  new things
coming.  They don't know where to look.<br>
<br>


     Unless and until you get your evolution completed.  Unless
and until  you reach that  absolute state of  understanding the
chaos will remain.<br>
<br>


     So  one  has  to  try  to  get  to  that.   But  one  must
understand: You cannot pay for  it.  There is no effort.  After
getting realization  they feel so satisfied,  they forget about
it.  But after that you must know how to give it to others.  As
Christ has said: "The light which is enlightened you do not put
it under the table!"<br>
<br>


     That's how what happens that, though I give realization to
some  hundred people,  only out  of  them five,  six will  come
forward to help  us out.  But still  I must say, a  lot of work
has  been  done.   Especially  Austria.  I  am  very  proud  of
Austria,  and the  way they  have never  given me  any problem,
never  - very  good  people  have come  out  of Austria.   Very
balanced, level headed people.  Very level headed.<br>
<br>


     They  are not  extremists, they  don't go  to extremes,  so
there is no  fanaticism about them.  They  are sensible people.
And something so lucky that Austria was found out.  Because I
never expected  that in Austria  there will be so  many people.
But  somehow -  like water  finds it's  own level,  Sahaja Yoga
finds its own level.  We just come down to Austria.  We haven't
been  to Norway,  to Sweden,  to Denmark,  Finland.  I  visited
those places, because of my husbands job but I have not .......<br>
<br>


     Now we  have sixteen centers in  Australia.  And Australia
is a very progressive Sahaja  Yoga thing.  We have  got schools
now  there.  They  are  running schools  and  the teachers  are
extremely well-behaved and visionaries  and they look after the
children very  well.  The  government people sent  somebody for
observation and they have  remarked that whatever they proclaim
that's  what   they  manifest.    And  they  have   given  good
certificates to us.<br>
<br>


     But the greatest  achievement on the outward  life is this
that Cambridge University has accepted Sahaja Yoga for research
work with respect.  By one doctor Lee who is doing the research
about  Sahaja Yoga  in  Cambridge University  -  he is  already
doctor.  And there is another great thing has happened in Delhi
University that the Delhi University has accepted that a person
can do, only a doctor can do  a P.H.D. of we can say a doctorat
in  Sahaja Yoga  and he  gets  the highest  degree, called  the
doctor  of medicine.   And perhaps  after some  time they  will
allow anyone  to do that.  This  is about the medicine  part of
it.<br>
<br>


     In agriculture  we have done  lots of research by  say, we
have somebody here, an expert of agriculture.  He has also done
a lot  of research  and he  found out  that with  vibrations he
started after realization.  If you vibrate the water and if you
water the  plants with that  then sometimes you might  get even
ten times more breed that's what  they did in India.  In one of
the  agriculture universities.   But here  also they  found out
that there  is tremendous difference  between the growth  of an
ordinary plant.<br>
<br>


     Another thing that I found  out in agriculture that if you
give  vibrations, then  even an  ordinary cow  can give  lot of
milk.  But if  you have hybrid cows than you  see it's not good
for the  brain, because a  person who takes hybrid  milk also,
gets hybrid.  I  mean his brain gets little  wobbly.  So better
to have a  pure milk from a  cow which is not been  put to this
kind of an experimentation.<br>
<br>


     Moreover food also, if you  eat hybrid food it's not very
good for us, for that spoils  our nerves I think.  But ordinary
seeds  you cannot  use,  because they  have  weakened and  they
cannot reproduce.  So, when we  vibrate them, they produce very
well, just like - better  than even sometimes hybrid things and
the  food  tastes   very  well,  and  it   doesn't  give  those
complications.
<br>
<br>

     So  this  can  help  in   agriculture  in  India  and  the
government has allotied us a lot of land where we are going now
to experiment and  we are going to  start experimentation there
to show  that how we  can use this.   But many farmers  who are
Sahaja Yogis  have done a lot  of job and they  have discovered
that even animals and this what you call farming, everything is
helped very much by vibrations.<br>
<br>


     So it improves the lives of  people.  We have on the other
side,  social side,  I can  tell  you that  we have  marriages,
international  marriages.  We  arrange international  marriages
between  people, they  have to  know  each other  and they  are
together and  first of all they  are together for one  and half
month with us on the tour.<br>
<br>


     They can see each other and the marriages are fixed and we
have seen that  such marriages are extremely  successful.  99 %
marriages are successful.   Once in a while maybe  a mishap but
mostly there are no divorces that take place.  Once in a while,
if it's not successful we have no objections to divorce also.<br>
<br>


     But mostly they  are successful and they  get children who
are  very  intelligent  and  who  are  themselves  born-realized
children mostly.   So the problem  is much less and  the family
life  improves.  The  quality  of life  is  1000 times  better.
People are  very joyous, happy,  they do not complain  and they
enjoy life and  they give to others.  They share  what joy they
have.<br>
<br>


     <b>Interviewer:</b> What do you think are the important points in
the education  of children?  What  is important to be  given to
the children?<br>
<br>


      <b>Shri Mataji:</b> First if they  get realization.  If they are
already born realized  no problem, but if they  have been given
their realization  then they  will start to  see things  from a
different  level.   They  become  the Spirit.   So  their  self
respect  awakens.  Such  children  behave in  a very  dignified
manner.   They  talk  in  a  very  elderly  manner.   They  see
solutions of all kinds and  they are tremendous beings.  But we
have to guide them properly by our own behaviour.<br>
<br>


     How we behave,  the greatest thing is how  we behave that's
how the children  like.  We put the children to  some tests how
they are.  We  find out if they have any  physical problems, we
cure them.  If they have mental problems we cure them.  If they
have any other problems, social problems or anything, we try to
help them out.  So that basically  if a human being is alright
in childhood then fundamentals are alright for the child.<br>
<br>


     The foundation is laid down then  to build a child up in a
good  quality is  not difficult.   So  now we  find like  great
artists are there.  There are great musicians.  At a very young
age, they  have started playing  violin.  I mean  suddenly they
have become dynamic also and very humble.  They are very humble
and selfrespected and very well behaved.<br>
<br>


     Surprising how  the atmosphere  is and  how it  works out.
And the other day  a lady asked me about the  women then I told
her that  a womans power as  a mother is very  great.  She felt
hurt about  it and  I did not  mean that you  should be  just a
mother.  She is  a mother, means she is  compassionate.  She is
kind.   She is  not aggressive  like men.   That is  a very  big
quality that is a very big power  in a woman, that's what I was
suggesting.  That  that is  what we  have to  have.  Is  not to
compete with men.   This is Madness.  To compete  with men, and
to go about like that.<br>
<br>


     So we  have to understand  that life has to  be enjoyable.
Life should be  a blessing, not to be a  misery.  We create our
own miseries by  these false ideas by our  own conflictions, we
have in our mind mental projections  we have in our mind or our
own obstinacy, whatever  it is.  All these things  can be cured
if  you take  to Sahaja  Yoga,  because you  become a  balanced
person, level  headed, mild  person and  you become  a witness.
The  whole thing  becomes like  a show,  like a drama and  you
become fearless, you start seeing the whole thing like a drama.
This is what a human being has to achieve.<br>
<br>


     We  talk of  peace, we  talk of  no war,  we talk  of many
things like this, atomic bomb, this  and that.  All that is not
going  to work  out.  Only  what is  going to  work out  is the
transformation  of  human  beings.   If the  human  beings  are
transformed things  will work out absolutely  first class.  Not
only that, but that they will enjoy the bliss of life.<br>
<br>


     We are  missing the  point all together.   This is  a very
important thing  that human  beings must  say one  thing: "What
have you achieved  out of all this?" Just for  a minute to stop
and think.<br>
<br>


     <b>Interviewer:</b> What are the causes of illness?<br>
	 <br>
	 

     <b>Shri   Mataji:</b>  The   physical,  mental,   emotional,  all
illnesses are caused by the imbalances that live within us.  By
our extreme behaviour.  And supposing, say now cancer.  Cancer is
caused by  the overactivity of the  sympathetic nervous system.
Supposing a person is a very sad person, he cries and weeps and
all the  time feels guilty  and thinks  he is the  worst person
ever  born.  He  has committed  so many  sins and  all sorts  of
nonsense.  Then he goes to the  left side, according to us, and
crosses  over to  the collective  subconscious area  and there,
according to us, what they call as Protein 58 and Protein 52.<br>
<br>


     Doctors  call it  that way,  but we  call it  as the  dead
souls.  They  exist there and they  catch hold of you  and they
trigger the cancer.  But supposing  by any chance you can bring
the attention fully away from that  in the centre.  You can get
cured.  So it is the centres  within us which are subtle, which
are  basically  seven  centres.   There are  many  others,  but
basically seven.  If you can put them right you cannot have any
sickness or illness of any kind.<br>
<br>


     <b>Interviewer:</b> Can you explain.  You said, that your parents
supported you very  much in your learning and  in your studies?
Is it correct?<br>
<br>


     <b>Shri Mataji:</b> Yes, of course!<br>
	 <br>
	 

     <b>Interviewer:</b> Is  it normal that the  parents support their
child in a  form like this?  <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> In  India all parents support their child.<br>
<br>


     <b>Interviewer:</b> And  you can  learn everything what  you want to?<br>
	 <br>
	 

     <b>Shri Mataji:</b> Yes, yes, I mean that is true.  But the basic
thing is: Parents  are very benevolent to  their children, very
kind to their children.  And  to them the childs education, the
childs  upbringing  and  the  childs life  is  very  important.
That's why  we know they  are so we  depend on them,  they look
after  us  and  they  are very  wise  people.   They  sacrifice
everything for  us.  So whatever  they say, we think  it's nice
and by doing this, we have not lost anything so far.<br>
<br>


     In  India if  you  find Indian  children,  when they  came
abroad they always  stop.  They are very  obedient children and
they  behave  very  well.   We don't  have  all  this  problem.
Teenage-problem,  homosexuality,  we   don't  know  even  these
problems.  Because  we are  so close with  the parents  all the
time.  They all the time watch  us we don't have drug problems.
None of these - only in the cities little bit it happens and it
disappears.   Because  parents  are  all the  time  with  their
children.   They   live  together,   the  whole   family  lives
together.<br>
<br>


     And not only  with the parents, but all  the relations and
all the  people in the village  and in the city  everyone knows
each  other.  Such  a joyful  system we  have, that  we do  not
normally fall,  sort of go to  wrong ways and methods  and we do
not become obstinate also.<br>
<br>


     <b>Interviewer:</b> But you grew up  in a Christian family!  It's
not a normal situation that Indian people are Christian?<br>
<br>


     <b>Shri Mataji:</b> Yes, I know, I was born in a Christian family
deliberately, because  I personally think that  protestants are
the  greatest fanatics.   They  are  very sophisticated,  their
fanaticism is  in their brain.   Nobody can make them  out that
they have  fanaticism, that  they are  very great  fanatics, the
greatest of all.   But that times were  very enlightened people
they understood Christ very well.<br>
<br>


     They say,  I told you about  Paul when I was  .....  First
time I took the  Bible in the hand and I  asked my father: "Who
is this  Paul?" He  said: "It's an  imprudor, forget  it, don't
believe him at  all." So they understood all  these things very
well because my father was a realized soul like Khalil Gibran.<br>
<br>


     If you  read Khalil  Gibran he says  the same  thing about
Paul, the same thing.  So if  you are an enlightened person you
see the essence of everything.  Whatever religion you are born,
you don't  ignore any  other religion, you  try to  learn about
other religion  and then you  find the  essence is the  same in
every religion.<br>
<br>


     What is there  to fight?  And that's how you  belong to no
religion,  you belong  to every  religion that's  what happens.
But my parents  were very enlightened people I must  say, and I
was very lucky to choose them as my parents.<br>
<br>


     <b>Interviewer:</b> You  have been an  enlightened child -  is it
correct?<br>
<br>


     <b>Shri  Mataji:</b> Yes,  I  have been  born  as an  enlightened child.<br>
	 <br>
	 

     <b>Interviewer:</b>  You  don't  feel  sometimes  very  lonesome,
because all the others are different?<br>
<br>


     <b>Shri  Mataji:</b> No,  No.   If  you know  how  to share  with
others.  Actually  I was  like a  mother to  them from  my very
childhood.  When my father and mother went to jail, I was about
5 1/2 years of age.  So I had all the duties of the house in my
little  frock  and I  used  to  get  all  the duties  like  the
grandmother.  I never felt lost.  My  life on the whole is very
collective  on temperament  I am  extremely collective.   I can
live  anywhere, I  can sleep  anywhere and  I can  live in  the
jungles, I have no problems or that I am extremely collective.<br>
<br>


     I was  expressing my  temperament from very  childhood.  I
was very friendly  with all the people from that  area where we
were living and my mother was known as Nirmalas mother.  Father
was known as Nirmalas father.  So  they said: "We have lost our
identity because of her."<br>
<br>


     So I was a very friendly  person.  I never felt lonely and
when I am with myself I am never lonely at all.  I enjoy myself
very much.<br>
<br>


     <b>Interviewer:</b>  When  you  have  been to  that  ashram  with
Gandhi.  What were your impression, you remember about Gandhi?<br>
<br>


     <b>Shri Mataji:</b> Oh, Gandhiji was  a tremendous man and I used
to learn  a lot from him.   He was not at  all hypocrite that's
one thing.  And  he was not like politicians  who say something
do something  wrong.  He was  very outspoken and always  he put
himself on  the testing point.   And he  used to confess  if he
made mistakes immediately.  One  very great incident I remember
when I was a small child.   They were having a meeting together
and we  girls were  there sitting, only  giving them  water and
things to  all the  people.  People  were there  like Jawaherlal
Nehru and Mollana  Azad.  All these people  were sitting there.
They  were discussing  something  and  then suddenly  Mahatmaji
Gandhiji said: "I  was very late, we will have  lunch here." So
they said: "Yes we will have lunch here."<br>
<br>


     They had to go to the  guest house which was far away.  So
Mahatmaji Gandhiji asked  for "Baa".  She had gone  out.  So he
got up,  he had  a key  with him always  of the  store-room, he
opened the store and he asked  the people who were in charge of
cooking  to measure  everything according  to the  people there
are,  properly  everything.   And  then they  measured  it  out
everything was done.<br>
<br>


     Then he  put the key back  and then he went  and sat there
nicely.  So these  people said: "Bapu, we did not  know you have
to  take so  much troubles.   You  see to  go all  the way  and
looking for her.   It didn't take much time,  about 15 minutes,
but still.  So he said: "What  do you think?" This is the blood
of my country, I cannot allow it to be wasted.
