<h1 class=title>Enlightened people will change the world</h1>
<br>
<i>Iain Maynard 
Ankara - Turkish Daily News. 27 April 2001.<br></i>
<br>

<i>Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi granted TDN an exclusive interview the day after the Swisshotel in which she was staying was attacked by Chechen separatist terrorists. Although the adjoining room had been hit by two bullets, she and her entourage were completely unperturbed. In fact, being in her presence you get an overwhelming feeling of love, compassion, patience and security such as a child would feel in his mother's arms. Shri Mataji has no political agenda and is not after any material wealth. What she teaches is a message of global love, tolerance and oneness together with spiritual wealth and well being. </i><br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> Starting with the attack by Chechen terrorists on your hotel last night. Were you and your entourage in any danger? <br>
<br>


<img src="/img/what/lectures/Yogo1.jpg" width="283" height="202" alt="" border="0" align="left" hspace=10><b>Shri Mataji:</b> Laughs. No, not at all. I know they were stupid. That's all. But what I'm trying to say is they don't understand the implications of all this. See, in India we had one person called Cinnah; wanted to have a separate Pakistan. Then we had Bangladesh. Of course the gentleman who achieved this was also killed by them. No we have Ceylon. We have Burma. All these countries wanted to have their own territory because the people, some people were interested in getting prime ministership and so on. Now I am told that Pakistan is in a very, very bad shape. India is doing much better. Very bad shape because if on the basis of religion you start having territory, it doesn't work out. And all these countries I have told you are doing very badly. It's a mess everywhere. So, what have they achieved? Some land that's all. That's what they think they have become now. Prime ministers and this and that. They are all gone, finished. And some of them are in jail. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> As I understand, some countries like to become independent for financial reasons. For example Scotland. Scotland is part of Britain and Britain pays a lot of money to the EU and gets little in return. But if Scotland becomes independent, and some Scottish people would like that, it would become a small country and receive more money from the EU. <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> It won't work out. It's the wrong conception. On the contrary, you should join the main and there you become effective. It will never work out. You see, they are just fighting for nonsense. Ireland. What a state. Your's is such a country that has ruled all over, everything. Now, you become one with them, and I am sure this will really give you full advantage to express yourself. Because you are all the time fighting, want to have separate... There are very few who started this. Now, it's very much prolonged I think now. Better thing is to surrender to wisdom and become one with the main country and you'll be amazed because you will be part and parcel of that country. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> Today is Turkey's National Sovereignty and Children's Day. Do you have a message for Turkey on this day? <br>
<br>


<img src="/img/what/lectures/Yogo2.jpg" width="255" height="167" alt="" border="0" align="left" hspace=10><b>Shri Mataji:</b> Oh my God. I was so very happy about it. See, what they don't understand is what we are doing will have an effect on our children. Are we creating Hell for them? We must think from the children's point of view. What are we giving them? And today is a very great day because I myself I feel that we are really exploiting our children. We don't think about them. And the way we are mad after our own... They are maniacs I must say. The way they are going on. But what are you going to give to your children? You have to give them peace. You have to give them joy. Are you doing that? It is just a few lovely people. Others have lost their heads I think. Just think of your children. They should have a very beautiful, peaceful, joyous country. Shouldn't they? These old Johnnies are not going to live for ever. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> You have been awarded several prizes for peace, including if I'm not wrong, the UN Peace Medal. <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> I don't know how many I've had. My God. See, I don't care for all awards and all that. And recently they gave one in India. It's called as the Jewel of Humanity. I told them I don't want it and I'll not go to Bombay. So they came to Pune to give it. You see these awards and all that for me have no value because do many get it. So many are getting it. I don't want any certificate from anyone. I don't need it. But they want to give. And some don't want to give. Also there are some who don't want to give because, say, I am not a Catholic. So some people won't give me. Because I am not a Christian, they won't give me. It's like that. Stupid. You see. I am none of these and they do not judge me on merits. If they judge me on merits, these awards have some meaning, but they don't. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> What activities does Sahaja Yoga do world wide to promote peace and protection of children? <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> First and foremost thing is we are trying to transform human beings to a higher level of awareness. By that you see so many things drop out. For example your addiction to things like drugs and all that drops out. Then so many diseases are cured and a person becomes a very beautiful, independent personality and collectively conscious, you see. So such a group of people. Such a society, which is of enlightened people, can change the whole world tomorrow.<br>
<br>
 

<b>TDN:</b> How does a person obtain this enlightenment? This Self Realization as I have heard it called?<br>
<br>
 

<img src="/img/what/lectures/Yogo3.jpg" width="255" height="167" alt="" border="0" align="left" hspace=10><b>Shri Mataji:</b> You see. There are two things about it. There are very many seekers about, all over the world. Whether they are black, white, yellow, anything; they are all seekers of truth and what happens is they have a power within them every one of them. It is in the triangular bone [Sacrum Bone] called as KUNDALINI. But call it by any name. It rises and gives you this connection with the Divine. It's a very, very simple thing that works out. But because the time is there. This is the time. Also because they are seekers. Because they are so genuine. That's why they get it. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> When this KUNDALINI energy rises, what are its effects on people and how does a person know this energy is active? <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> You get a complete transformation, you see. It depends on how much you perfect it. But, firstly we say there are six enemies human beings have. These six enemies are like anger and what you can call perversion in sex habits. Then it is also greed and corruption; then also you have got attachments. People become dishonest because their son has to be this or that. All these kind of identifications are there. And also pride. Like we are something great. It's an ego problem. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> Like the seven deadly sins as the English say: Pride, Sloth, Avarice, Lust... <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> The English have; but they are coming round. Everywhere is to come round. Every action has a reaction and they are realising it. Now, they left our country without doing anything about it. How did they manage? So they also care for the world reputation. I think that's it. It's a small country and they thought they achieved a lot and all that, but it's not really. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> Is Sahaja Yoga like Sufism? Islamic spiritualism? <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> Not 'ism'. That's the difference between the two. Anyone can call himself a sufi. It's not an 'ism'. 'Ism' means a kind of theory or a kind of group who believes in something. It's not like that. Sahaja Yoga makes you a sufi. Sufi means 'cleansed'. It cleanses you and you get rid of all these horrible things and you become a transformed person. Most of the sufi's didn't know how they became sufis. They were born like that. And the others who talk about that, like Tao. You must have heard about the Chinese thing Tao; when they describe a sage, they say a sage is like this, like that. But how does he become like that? So that part is missing, even in the sufi theories. How you become a sufi? Just by going round and round, you don't become a sufi. By following a certain code of life, you don't become a sufi. What does it is KUNDALINI. That has to rise. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> So other forms of mysticism. What they strive to attain, is where Sahaja Yoga starts?<br>
<br>
 

<b>Shri Mataji:</b> They try to achieve this by putting pressures on themselves. All kinds of control and all that. That's not the way. You have to be a free person. With KUNDALINI, you become a free person. Nobody has to tell you 'don't do that'; just you become. Becoming is the point. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> How does Sahaja Yoga or a Sahaja Yogi benefit the society in which he lives?<br>
<br>
 

<b>Shri Mataji:</b> He creates a new society of his own. And then by that others are also helped. They see a society where there is no greed, there's no fighting, there's no quarreling, all living together happily and enjoying each other and understanding. Another thing happens is they start seeing what's wrong with their own country; what's wrong with your own societies; what's wrong with all the religions that are there. He just becomes a kind of person who sees things, so such a society is formed and these people infuse others. That's how a self realised soul works it out. I don't go everywhere. They say this is in 86 countries. I haven't visited even half of them. But what happens is that person who gets it goes and gives it to another and because it is the truth you see, it works out. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> Turkey is located in the middle of several volatile regions. For example, the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East with its present Israel and the Palestinians. Can Turkey and or Turkish Yogis play a role in bringing peace to these regions? <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> Of course. Why not. Of course. Turkey has one very great blessing. It has had so many sufis. And if you read them, it is a description of Sahaja Yogis. They didn't call them Sahaja Yogis but they were because they are described to be like this or that and when they tell about their own experiences in poetry you are amazed to see they are talking like Sahaja Yogis. That's the reason. Because of that blessing, Turkey has become very important for me also. That spirituality will definitely take a shape here and maybe, I almost feel, that Islam will be really be shown in Turkey very well and maybe it will help people to correct their ideas about Islam. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> Speaking of Islam, the actions by the Afghan government by destroying the statues of Buddha. What was India's reaction and what was Sahaja's reaction? <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> You see for us they have been a curse throughout. You see India respects everything, all the religions. The only country that respects all the religions in the same manner. So for them it was a shock. They are very, very well know structures and we all respect it well, no doubt. Not because they are Buddhist or anything, but as a piece of art. But these people have no sense left in their heads. They believe only in destruction. Now, by destroying that, do you think that Islam will spread? What will they achieve out of that. Otherwise, that was the place people used to visit; they used to have tourists. All this is finished now. That's the only glorifying thing they have, What else is there? They don't have Taj Mahal or any one of our temples. Nothing. They had only those statues. That also is lost. They don't know what was there. Many people went to see that. Many people went to Afghanistan as we go to see Egypt. What are they going to see, all the dead bodies? Some sort of an idea they have about Islam.<br>
<br>
 

<b>TDN:</b> In an interview with the Sabah newspaper, you told reporters it was greed that brought Turkey down. <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> It is true. See, the question is Turks are such artists. Such beautiful artists and they make such nice things out of nothing. So, I don't know why they wanted to get after money and ruin their own country. See, the art that they have is sufficient to give them all the blessings of Lakshmi (Indian deity representing the Divine qualities of wealth, well being and satisfaction). But they are not satisfied. They want to make the modern style of money. In that you get lost, you tell lies, you cheat, you do everything. But as far as art is concerned you're producing something great and that is the real wealth of this country. But one should be satisfied with it. Thing is if you want to have say material things, then you can't. You cannot enjoy that. What we are having now is a recession, a big one. But art cannot have recession. So they should have taken to their own knowledge of art, their own love of art and they would have been prefect alright. But they don't understand their own nature. Everybody is trying to become American, even in India. <br>
<br>


<b>TDN:</b> Have you travelled anywhere else in Turkey apart from Istanbul? <br>
<br>


<b>Shri Mataji:</b> Not so far. I would love to. This time I have got four days. for that. I want to go to different places. I haven't. You see, I'm so busy when I'm here and then I just disappear. But this time I'm being a little selfish. It's a wonderful country. you can do a lot here. I mean, even this fellow with his Islam, Islam, Islam. He too became alright.
