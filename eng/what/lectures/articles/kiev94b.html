<h1 class=title>Public Program</h1>
<br>
<i>Kyiv, September 18, 1994<br></i>
<br>
I  bow to all the seekers of Truth. At the very  outset we have to know that Truth is what it  is. We cannot change it, we cannot describe I it and unfortunately at this human awareness we cannot know it. Whatever I'm trying to tell you here you should not take it as a blind faith. The blind faith has created lots of problems for us. But you must keep your mind open like a scientist and if it is proved you must accept it honestly. Because it is for your good, for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world.<br>
<br>


In the evolutionary process we have reached up to the point where we can be called as human beings, but we have not reached our highest goal. Because we do not know the Absolute Truth. What we know is a relative truth, and so there is difference of opinions and people argue, fight, also have wars. If everybody knows the same truth, how can there be any fight? To become the Spirit is the only way you can know the Absolute Truth. The truth about you is that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, these emotions. Also you are not these conditionings and this ego. You say "my intellect, my emotions, my body", it is all mine. Who is this me? So, what is going to happen now, that you have to become the Spirit. Because you are the Spirit. The second great truth is, as you see these flowers they are all miracles. We take them for granted, we don't even wonder how they have been created by this Mother Earth. Who does this work? Who runs our heart? If you ask the doctors they will say it is Autonomous Nervous System, but who is this auto? So we have to understand that there is some power which does this. This power is the all pervading power of Divine Love. In Koran we call it Ruh, and in the Bible we call it as Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost. In Indian scriptures it is called as Param Chai-tanya. Patanjali has called it as Rithambara Pragya. Whatever name you may call it but it exists all the time in every part and parcel of creation and does all the living work. We cannot explain the living work. As you know science is very limited. It cannot say why are you on this earth, what is the purpose of your life, what is your identity. Also it is immoral. Out of science people have created atom bombs and all kinds of things without any discrimination. You too had here this disaster Chernobyl. All this is because of unlimited movement of science.<br>
<br>


So then, what should we do. Within us lies a power which we call as Kundalini. As it is shown there it is in the triangular bone called as Sacrum. That means the Greeks knew it is a sacred bone. This Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost. Very surprisingly there is no mention of the Primordial Mother in the scripture. We have got Father, the God, Son, the God, but no Mother. They call her Holy Ghost. This Kundalini is the reflection of that Primordial Mother within you. She is seated there to give you your second birth. She is your own mother and she is anxious to give you your second birth. In Sanskrit language an enlightened soul is called as vijaha, means "born twice", "twice born", also the birds are called as vijaha. Because they are first born as eggs and then they become the birds. In the same way a human being is born as a human being and then he becomes an enlightened soul. This bird is very different from the egg. In the same way an enlightened soul is very different from a human being. So it is very important for us to become the enlightened ones.<br>
<br>


Christ was a pure Logos, called first sound. We call it Omkara. He was too pure to understand human beings and what he has said in the fifth chapter of Matthew, that "if your eye does anything wrong, then take it out. If your hand does anything wrong, cut it out. If somebody slaps you on this side, you give him another one". This is very difficult for human beings. I think most of the people in the West, especially, would be without eyes, without hands, because there is no value for morality. But he has said that you are to be "born again". So same people brand themselves as born again. You may be a Christian, Hindu, Moslem, anything, you can commit any sin. Although this "born again" is the same style, it is just a brand. There is no transformation. Mohammed Sahib who came afterwards and he thought Christ has been very strict with men, so he got the Shariat which was given by Moses to Jews for the Moslems. Now, imagine this Shariat is so horrible that if you steal anything you cut your hands, if you abuse anybody you cut your tongue. I think most of the Americans would be without tongues, because at every sentence it is there. But Mohammed Sahib gave this Shariat to the Moslems. And he thought that this Shariat is very strong on men so he also had brought this strictness for women. Both Mohammed Sahib and Christ were different people, absolutely above our grasp.<br>

<br>


It is very difficult to follow them, so you have to be enlightened soul if you want to follow them. This is what Sahaja Yoga is, that your Kundalini awakens and starts passing through six centers and comes out of your fontanel bone area and connects you to this all pervading power of Divine Love. We have so far used only the power of hatred, never of Pure Love - Love which is devoid of greed or any kind of expectation, Pure Love without any lust. And this is the power which is doing all the beautiful things for us. So, first thing that happens to you that you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your fontanel bone area. This is the actualization of baptism. It is not just some priest puts some water and says "now you are a Christian or a Moslem", it is not like that. It is an actualization, it is a happening within you. So, when this Kundalini rises she passes through these six centers. All the problems of the world are mostly because of human beings. And most of the human problems are because of these centers, because they are for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. So, when the Kundalini passes through these six centers she enlightens them, she integrates them and also she nourishes them. Thus many diseases are cured. Many mental diseases are cured also. Even financial problems improve, emotional problems improve and a person becomes extremely dynamic as well as extremely compassionate. We have many musicians in India, who were not so good when they came to Sahaga Yoga and today they are world famous. This is nothing, there are so many things happen that people who have never been orators, become orators, they become poets, writers, all kinds of potential capacities start manifesting. We are all the time thinking and the thoughts rise and fall, rise and fall. They either come from the past or from the future. So we are jumping in the past or in the future all the time, but if I say "Be in your present" you cannot. But when the Kundalini rises she elongates those thoughts and there is a little space in between which is the present, which expands, and you become thoughtlessly aware. You are aware but absolutely thoughtless. Then inspirations start coming and you don't know from where they come.<br>

<br>


We go into jeopardy because of our maybe wrong decisions. We have six centers. But the lowest center is for our innocence. Our innocence can never be destroyed because it is eternal, only it can be covered with some clouds. But with the awakening of the Kundalini the innocence comes back to us, our attention becomes absolutely innocent, and there is no lust and greed in our attention. It is very subtle that we can feel our own centers on our finger tips, and whenever we put our attention on anyone we can feel his centers also. Because who is the other? The microcosm has become the macrocosm, a drop has become the ocean, you become a global personality and then you talk a language of centers. You transcend all the limitations of rationalism, nationalism - all kinds of "isms". Your attention becomes innocent and it acts, whenever you put your attention it works. Above all you know the Absolute Truth. On your finger tips you can know the Absolute Truth. Any persons who don't believe in God can ask a question "Is there God?". And immediately they will start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on their hands because that is the Truth. Christ was the Son of God, no doubt, so you can ask the question "Was he the Son of God", and immediately you start feeling cool breeze on your fingers tips. Now, if you know how to correct your centers you can correct your centers because you get the self knowledge. And also you get the knowledge about others. You can cure others also. When you become thoughtlessly aware you become absolutely peaceful. You become very dynamic but you feel very young. I'm about seventy three years of age, now I am seventy two. And every day I'm traveling, every day practically. I do not think that I'm traveling, I'm sitting everywhere that's what I feel. In the same way you all drop your age and become much younger and happier. You become so peaceful, and wherever you go you manifest peace and joy. Joy is a singular thing, but happiness and unhappiness are the two sides of a coin. If your ego is pampered you feel happy, if it is punctured you feel unhappy. But joy is singular, you become the witness and see everything as a drama. And really you swim in the ocean of joy. Thus you enter into the Kingdom of God. This is the Last Judgment. It is for you to decide whether you want to enter into the Kingdom of God or you want to destroy yourself. And then you are surprised how blissful everything becomes. You are protected all the time, no Mafia can trouble you, all Mafia people will be destroyed when we'll have a lot of Sahaja Yogis here. It has happened in Italy, the Mafia of Italy is completely destroyed. And sixty percent dishonest people, politicians and others are in jail. This happens when the Divine power works.<br>
<br>


I'm happy to see you all in such good health. First, time when I had come there were so many patients of Chernobyl, and last year there was a negative force of this White Brotherhood. All such forces are now destroyed practically everywhere. But one thing I would like to warn you - the western culture is coming. It is the most dangerous thing you can think of. First of all you have to become absolutely stupid to follow. Like there is an actress who married eight times in America. And thousands of people went to see her going for her honeymoon with her twenty five years younger husband. And there were ten helicopters hollering around her house and they were parachuting down with their cameras. So many of them fell on the tree, some fell on the people. Such stupid things they are teaching, they are only two hundred year old people. There is one fellow Simpson who murdered his wife, so now they are saying we should not have marriages, because people murder wifes. They followed this stupid Freud for years together when he said that there is a bad relationship between a son and a mother. There is no wisdom, they have no wisdom, they are not matured at all. They are good at making money and also because they have a country which has a lot of things. But they are now in recession all over. Everywhere in Europe they are in recession. And they are exporting all their junk. Like in Turkey people were influenced by German television and they started taking all German things, buying all German things, even the food. They felt an inferiority complex. But they are great artists, I don't know how these people impress such matured, wise people. As a result that country has become very poor. They are also selling here a lot of junk, and even in Russia they are having shops and shops of this junk. In India you can't find one shop with imported things, not even one shop. Only those who go abroad can bring something, very little. So, you should not really buy anything from these shops because these things they are throwing away. There is overproduction and they don't know what to do with it, it cannot fetch any money. Also this modern music, it's very bad for the brain, the doctors have said, everybody said but nobody listen. Now they have got intoxicated.<br>
<br>


But your people are wise, take to wisdom, not their stupid fashions. Specially women have to be very careful. They started a fashion of exposing all the legs with the six inches of skirt. And all of them, all those women got varicose veins, pains, arthritis, all kinds of diseases. Then the fashion came where they had long skirts but open. In such cold countries why do these stupid things like this? But your people have lots of wisdom, now don't loose it, specially the women, you have to preserve this country, and not to make yourself cheap. Women who are cheap are never respected. I'm really worried about this point that if you start taking to Western culture you will be completely lost nation. We have experience of this in India and Mahatma Ghandy started the movement that nothing from abroad we should buy. And the British who ruled us for three hundred years had to go back. So please, I would request you all not to take to this junk and not to use it.<br>
<br>


I'm so thankful to you for your love and for your kindness. People of not only Kiev but the whole of Ukraine are extremely lovable. I don't know how to express myself, because I myself become like an ocean of love.<br>
<br>


I hope all of you will get your realization tonight. It is your freedom, I respect. If you don't want to have your realization, you may go. I cannot fore � on you. As I told you this is the Last Judgment. Mohammed Sahib has said: "When Kiama. will come", means when the resurrection time will come then "your hands will speak", "they will give evidence against you", means they will tell you what centers are wrong in you. So this process is only for ten minutes that you will feel this cool breeze but those who do not want should leave the hall. It is spontaneous, it is Sahaja. Saha means "with", Ja is "born". It is born with you this right to have this Yoga, means the union with the Divine Power. You cannot pay for it, this is one thing you should understand that you cannot pay for your spiritual life. You can pay for this hall, maybe for the carpets but you can't pay for Divine Love. We have no organization. There are sixty five nations where we have Sahaja Yoga. Specially in Russia in small place Togliatti we have more than twenty one thousand Sahaja Yogis. It is all working so well, because it is coming from your heart.<br>
